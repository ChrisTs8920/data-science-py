# Data Science with Python

## Description

This repository contains a collection of Data science projects, made in python.

Libraries used:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- sklearn
- NLTK

## Heart Disease Classification

This project uses Machine Learning (classification algorithm - S.V.M. or Support Vector Machine) to predict whether a patient has an increased chance of a heart attack or not. It then shows the accuracy of the algorithm, and plots the different parameters of the data set.

Data was provided by [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset/data).

## Corpus analysis

This project plots statistics for some of the built-in [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) text books:

- Lexical richness and percentage of text taken up by various words.
- Stemming vs Lemmatization.
- str.split() vs nltk.tokenize().
- Frequency Distributions.
